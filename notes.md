TypeScript — as its name suggests — is the typed version of JavaScript. This means we can specify types to different variables at the time of declaration. They will always hold the same type of data in that scope.

Typing is a very useful feature to ensure reliability and scalability. Type checking helps to ensure our code works as expected. Also, it helps in hunting down bugs and errors and properly documenting our code.

There are three different types in TypeScript: 
 - any type
 - Built-in type
 - User-defined type

The any data type is the superset of all the data types in TypeScript. Giving any variable the type of any is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable.

```let myVariable: any = 'This is a string'```
